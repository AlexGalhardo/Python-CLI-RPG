#### Currently Version: Alpha (has some bugs to fix and a lot of refactoring to do yet)

### Introduction
  - I made this program to learn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming and to learn a little about Python programming language, beyond, of course,  the best software engineering practices, like SOLID, Design Patterns, Clean Code, KISS, DRY, and so on.
  - I was inspired by my favorite video game, Tibia Online, where I got all the names of the classes and monsters from the program.
  - I hope you enjoy playing this awesome command line RPG turn-based game, just like me, who really enjoyed developing this game.


### How To Use The Program

    $ git clone https://github.com/AlexGalhardo/Python-RPG.git
